**\# Global Population Analysis Dashboard**

This project is an interactive web dashboard for analyzing global population data. Built with Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly, it transforms a raw CSV dataset into a multi-page tool for exploring demographic trends.

The primary goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data project skills: from data cleaning and feature engineering in a Jupyter Notebook to building and deploying a user-friendly, interactive dashboard.

‚ú® Key Features

The dashboard is organized into four distinct tabs for a clear user experience:

**üåé Global Overview:**

A fully interactive Plotly Choropleth map to visualize metrics like population, density, and dependency ratios by country.

High-level global metric cards for total population, average density, and average sex ratio.

Expandable "Top 10" and "Bottom 10" lists for various metrics.

**üìà Demographic Deep-Dive:**

Age Structure Analysis: An interactive scatter plot comparing the percentage of young (0-14) vs. old (60+) populations, colored by continent.

Gender Analysis: A histogram showing the global distribution of sex ratios.

Density vs. Population: A log-scale scatter plot to analyze the relationship between a country's total population and its density.

**üîç Country-Specific Analysis:**

A drill-down tool allowing users to select a single country using dropdown filters (by continent, then country).

Displays key metrics and a donut chart of the selected country's age structure (Youth, Working-Age, Elderly).

**üÜö Country Comparison:**

A powerful comparison tool using a \`st.multiselect\` widget.

Generates a faceted bar chart to compare multiple countries side-by-side across key demographic metrics, with independent y-axes for accurate comparison.

\## üìä Data & Feature Engineering

The dashboard runs on a cleaned and enriched dataset. The original data was processed in a Jupyter Notebook (\`data_exploration.ipynb\`) to create more insightful metrics.

**Original Columns:**

\`\['Country', 'Population Aged 0 to 14 (%)', 'Population Aged 60 and Over (%)', 'Population density', 'Population(in millions)', 'Female Population(in millions)', 'Male Population(in millions)', 'Sex ratio (males per 100 females)'\]\`

**New Engineered Features:**

Working-Age Population (15-59) %: Calculated as \`100 - (% 0-14) - (% 60+)\`.

Youth Dependency Ratio: The number of young dependents for every 100 working-age people.

Old-Age Dependency Ratio: The number of elderly dependents for every 100 working-age people.

Total Dependency Ratio: The total number of dependents.

ISO Alpha-3 Codes: Generated using the \`country-converter\` library to enable mapping.

Continent: Generated using \`country-converter\` and \`pycountry-convert\` for filtering and grouping.
